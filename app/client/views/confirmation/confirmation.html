              For legal reasons, our university asks that you read and accept the terms of our liability waiver. Again, as we mentioned in the original lottery application - you <strong> must </strong> be 18 years or older or an MIT undergraduate by the day of the event, or <strong> we will refuse you admission at the door. We will be checking ID. </strong>
